# Cloud Video Uploader <!-- omit from toc -->

> A fullstack app to showcase the core functionality of a video uploading system in a cloud-based environment.
>
> Allows users to upload videos, which are then processed and stored in the cloud. The primary functionalities include user authentication, video upload, transcoding, and storage.

## Features

- Users can sign in/out using their Google account.
- Authenticated users can upload videos.
- Uploaded videos are transcoded into multiple formats (e.g., 360p, 720p).
- Users, whether signed in or not, can view a list of uploaded videos.
- Users can view individual videos.

## High-Level Architecture

The project utilizes various cloud services for different aspects of its functionality:

- **Video Storage (Cloud Storage):** Google Cloud Storage hosts raw and processed videos.
- **Video Upload Events (Cloud Pub/Sub):** Publish messages to a Cloud Pub/Sub topic to add durability for video upload events and process videos asynchronously.
- **Video Processing Workers (Cloud Run):** Utilizes Cloud Run to scale up and down based on video processing workloads using FFMPEG for transcoding.
- **Video Metadata (Firestore):** Stores metadata in Firestore for displaying processed videos in the web client.
- **Video API (Firebase Functions):** Uses Firebase Functions to create a simple API for uploading videos and retrieving video metadata.
- **Web Client (Next.js / Cloud Run):** Next.js is employed to build a web client for user interaction, hosted on Cloud Run.
- **Authentication (Firebase Auth):** Firebase Auth handles user authentication, integrating with Google Sign-in.

## Usage Trace

1. **User Sign Up:** Users can sign up using their Google account, with Firebase Auth handling user creation and Firestore storing additional user information.

2. **Video Upload:** Authenticated users can upload videos using a signed URL generated by a public Firebase Function. This ensures authentication before allowing video uploads.

3. **Video Processing:** Videos are processed asynchronously using Cloud Pub/Sub for decoupling upload and processing. Cloud Run scales based on processing workloads, and processed videos are stored in Cloud Storage with metadata in Firestore.
